## Addresses with the most 311 reports

Why are some addresses "hot spots"?

[2015-01-04] **Did KCMO drop the ADDRESS.WITH.GEOCODE?**  In July 2014 the #2 address below was #1 with a count of 3917, which is unchanged.  A blank address has become the most common since July 2014?

```{r}
counts <- sort(table(d$ADDRESS.WITH.GEOCODE), decreasing=TRUE)  
counts <- data.frame(Address=names(counts), Counts=counts)
row.names(counts) <- 1:nrow(counts)
head(counts, 250) 
```
