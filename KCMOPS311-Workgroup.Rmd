## Frequency Counts of Kansas City, MO 311 Reports
https://data.kcmo.org/311/KCMOPS311-Data/7at3-sxhp  
2015-01-03  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
filename <-  "KCMOPS311-2015-01-03-150046.csv"
d <- read.csv(filename, as.is=TRUE, colClasses="character")
options(width=120)
```
The current file has `r nrow(d)` rows.

## Work Groups

Work Groups are thought to be associated only with certain Department(s).  A crosstab of WorkGroup by Department would be a bit large, however.  The set of WorkGroups for a particular Department could be extracted fairly easily.
```{r}
length(table(d$WORK.GROUP))

x <- data.frame(table(d$WORK.GROUP))
x <- x[-43,]   # Record 43 is trash, so delete it [2015-01-04]   ## << check this next time
x
```
