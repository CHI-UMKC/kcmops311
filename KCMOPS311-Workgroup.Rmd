## Frequency Counts of Kansas City, MO 311 Reports
https://data.kcmo.org/311/KCMOPS311-Data/7at3-sxhp  
2014-07-11  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Data/Cities/KCMO/data-kcmo-org/KCMOPS311/")
filename <-  "KCMOPS311-2014-07-11-113827.csv"
d <- read.csv(filename, as.is=TRUE, colClasses="character")
options(width=120)
```
The current file has `r nrow(d)` rows.

## Work Groups

Work Groups are thought to be associated only with certain Department(s).  A crosstab of WorkGroup by Department would be a bit large, however.  The set of WorkGroups for a particular Department could be extracted fairly easily.
```{r}
length(table(d$WORK.GROUP))

data.frame(table(d$WORK.GROUP))
```
