## Frequency Counts of Kansas City, MO 311 Reports
https://data.kcmo.org/311/KCMOPS311-Data/7at3-sxhp  
2015-01-03  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
filename <-  "KCMOPS311-2015-01-03-150046.csv"
d <- read.csv(filename, as.is=TRUE, colClasses="character")
options(width=120)
```
The current file has `r nrow(d)` rows.

## Neighborhoods



```{r}
length(table(d$NEIGHBORHOOD))

data.frame(table(d$NEIGHBORHOOD))
```
## Neighborhoods and ZIP Codes

Neighborhoods often consist of several ZIP codes, but often only one or two are dominant.

```{r}
counts <- table(d$NEIGHBORHOOD, d$ZIP.CODE)
for (i in 3:nrow(counts))
{
  cat("\n")
  print(row.names(counts)[i])
  print(counts[i, counts[i,] > 0])
}        
```
